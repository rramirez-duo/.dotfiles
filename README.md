#Rueben's Dotfiles

I'm running these dotfiles on my "archbook" ([HP Chromebook 14](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/devices/hp-14-chromebook.html#hp-cb-14) with Arch linux installed over ChromeOS) even though most of them came from my Mac dev laptop. 

##Updating:
run `make` to cleanup or redeploy

Thanks to [Jack Franklin](https://github.com/jackfranklin/dotfiles) for the use of his beautifully simple Makefile approach at deployment!
